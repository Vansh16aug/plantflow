### Key Directories and Files

- **components/**: Reusable UI components like `LoadingSpinner`, `ResponsiveTable`, etc.  
- **features/**: Each feature module contains Redux slice + API logic:  
  - `auth/`, `operator/`, `reports/`, `trucks/`, `users/`, `workflows/`  
- **utils/**:
  - `apiLogger.js`, `apiTest.js`, `checkpointUtils.js`, `jwtDecode.js`

## User Roles

### Admin
- Full access to all features  
- Can manage users, workflows, and generate reports  
- Can monitor trucks at all checkpoints  

### Operator
- Assigned to one or more checkpoints  
- Can check-in/out trucks at assigned checkpoint  
- Can create trucks at Entry Gate only  
- Can view truck statuses related to their checkpoint  

---

## Checkpoint Flow

The system follows a circular checkpoint flow for trucks:

1. **Entry Gate**  
2. **Front Office**  
3. **Weigh Bridge**  
4. **QC**  
5. **Material Handling**  
6. **Weigh Bridge (Return)**  
7. **Front Office (Return)**  
8. **Entry Gate (Exit)**  

Trucks move sequentially through the above checkpoints. Each check-in/check-out is logged for reporting and real-time tracking.
